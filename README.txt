To run the project, the following files are needed:
map.html
script.js
main.css
Knockout and jQuery libraries

Steps to run the application:
Open map.html in a browser
The project displays a map with markers on seven popular places in San Francisco, California. 
Clicking on one of the locations displays ten attractions nearby.

Neighborhood Map project makes use of the following APIs:
Google Maps API to load a map
FourSquare API to load information about places of interest near the given locations, by means of an AJAX call.
Google street view service to display a street view image in the info window.

Notes:
map.html displays a list of locations of interest in a list view and as markers in a map. Clicking on one of adds places of interest nearby to the page, just below the map.

A filter textbox provides functionality to filter through the list.

I have referred to the code provided in Repsonsive Websites-Lesson 8 for implementing hamburger menu icon for smaller screen displays.
